<strong>An introduction to cluster computing and Stanford's Sherlock cluster</strong>
<p align="justify">
In this lecture, Mark Piercy will give an introduction to cluster computing concepts and some best practices for users. Clusters enable users to run computational tasks that are above and beyond what desktops and laptops are capable of in terms of CPU, RAM, I/O and data storage.  He will also give an overview of SRCC resources and it's main cluster Sherlock. On Sherlock users can use up to 2048 cores and submit thousands of computational tasks at once. He will cover the data storage options, queue and partition structure, SLURM resource manager, job submission basics and software available on Sherlock.
