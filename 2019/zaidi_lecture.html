<strong>Distributed Tools for the Statistician in the Age of Data Science with Azure</strong>
<p align="justify">

The developing age of data science has brought along a plethora of new tools for processing large amounts of data using complicated distributed systems. However, for the statistician interested in principled methods of statistical inference, i.e., generalization, interpretability and causality, much of the recent technology seems to fall short of the needed tools for conducting such data analysis in a scientific and reproducible manner. On the other hand, companies eager for data science/AI "insight" are expecting newly minted statisticians and data scientists to rapidly develop, deploy, and monitor statistical models in production in complex domains. This talk will present a few tools designed to assist the statistican in the process of training, deloying, validating, and monitoring statistical machine learning models in practice. While a few new tools will be presented, the focus is not on learning the intricacies of the technologies, but a description of best practices of using these tools to increase your productivity as a data analyst and statistician.
